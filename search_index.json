// code block\n}\n\nParameter vs argument\n\nParameter: a variable name that appears in the function declaration.\nArgument: a value that appears in the code when the function is invoked.\nParameters are always passed by value.\n\nReturn value\n\nA function always returns some value back to the caller.\nWhen return value is not specified, the function will return undefined.\nE.g. console.log\n\n\n\nScope\n\nGlobal scope\nVariables defined outside of an function\n\n\nFunction scope\n\nShadowing\n\nGlobal variable can be overriden inside a function.\nPreventable by redeclaring the same variable in the function.\n\n// shadowing\nvar a = \"a\";\nvar b = \"b\";\nfunction shadow() {\n  a = \"c\";     // shadowing\n  var b = \"c\"; // no shadowing\n}\n\nconsole.log(a); // a\nconsole.log(b); // b\nshadow();\nconsole.log(a); // c, shadowed\nconsole.log(b); // b\n\nHoisting\n\nBefore any JavaScript is executed, all function declarations are \"hoisted\" to the top of their current scope.\nFunctions can be called before they are defined in a scope.\nOnly declaration is hoisted. Assignment is not. So hoisted variables can still be undefined.\nThe best practice is to define functions at the top of the scripts, and variables at the top of the functions.\n\n// only declaration is hoisted\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  console.log(greeting);\n  var greeting = \"hello\";\n}\nsayGreeting(); // undefined\n\n// equivalent function\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  var greeting;\n  console.log(greeting);\n  greeting = \"hello\";\n}\n\n// hoisting prevents access of global variable\nvar greeting = \"hello\";\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  console.log(greeting); // undefined\n  var greeting = \"hello2\";\n}\nsayGreeting(); // undefined\n\nFunction as parameters\n\nA function passed into another function is called a callback.\n\nFunction expressions\n\nA function stored in a variable.\nAnonymous function.\n```js\nvar variable = function(params) {\n// anonymous function body\n}\n\nvariable();\n\n- Use the variable name to call the function.\n- Function expressions are not hoisted.\n\n```js\nsayGreeting();
