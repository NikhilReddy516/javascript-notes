// code block\n}\n\nParameter vs argument\n\nParameter: a variable name that appears in the function declaration.\nArgument: a value that appears in the code when the function is invoked.\nParameters are always passed by value.\n\nReturn value\n\nA function always returns some value back to the caller.\nWhen return value is not specified, the function will return undefined.\nE.g. console.log\n\n\n\nScope\n\nGlobal scope\nVariables defined outside of an function\n\n\nFunction scope\n\nShadowing\n\nGlobal variable can be overriden inside a function.\nPreventable by redeclaring the same variable in the function.\n\n// shadowing\nvar a = \"a\";\nvar b = \"b\";\nfunction shadow() {\n  a = \"c\";     // shadowing\n  var b = \"c\"; // no shadowing\n}\n\nconsole.log(a); // a\nconsole.log(b); // b\nshadow();\nconsole.log(a); // c, shadowed\nconsole.log(b); // b\n\nHoisting\n\nBefore any JavaScript is executed, all function declarations are \"hoisted\" to the top of their current scope.\nFunctions can be called before they are defined in a scope.\nOnly declaration is hoisted. Assignment is not. So hoisted variables can still be undefined.\nThe best practice is to define functions at the top of the scripts, and variables at the top of the functions.\n\n// only declaration is hoisted\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  console.log(greeting);\n  var greeting = \"hello\";\n}\nsayGreeting(); // undefined\n\n// equivalent function\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  var greeting;\n  console.log(greeting);\n  greeting = \"hello\";\n}\n\n// hoisting prevents access of global variable\nvar greeting = \"hello\";\nfunction sayGreeting() {\n  console.log(greeting); // undefined\n  var greeting = \"hello2\";\n}\nsayGreeting(); // undefined\n\nFunction as parameters\n\nA function passed into another function is called a callback.\n\nFunction expressions\n\nA function stored in a variable.\nAnonymous function.\n\nvar variable = function(params) {\n  // anonymous function body\n}\n\nvariable();\n\n\nUse the variable name to call the function.\nFunction expressions are not hoisted.\n\nsayGreeting(); // sayGreetings is not a function\nvar sayGreeting = function() {\n  console.log(\"hello\");\n}\n\n// equivalent code\nvar sayGreeting;\nsayGreeting();\nsayGreeting = function() {\n  console.log(\"hello\");\n}\n\nNamed function expressions\nvar variable = function name(params) {\n  // function body\n}\nvariable();\n// call name() gives an error\n\nInline function expressions\n\nUsing function expressions that pass a function into another function inline, is really common in JavaScript.\n```js\nfunction movies(messageFunction, name) {\nmessageFunction(name);\n}\n\nmovies(function displayFavorite(movieName) {\n  console.log(\"My favorite movie is \" + movieName);\n}, \"Finding Nemo\");\n\n- Anonymous inline function expressions are often used for function callbacks that are not going to be reused elsewhere.\n\n```js\nfunction movies(messageFunction, name) {\n  messageFunction(name);\n}\n\nmovies(function(movieName) {\n  console.log(\"My favorite movie is \" + movieName);\n}, \"Finding Nemo\");\n"},"intro-to-javascript/06-arrays.html":{"url":"intro-to-javascript/06-arrays.html","title":"Arrays","keywords":"","body":"Arrays\nArray properties\n\nlength\n\nArray methods\n\nreverse()\nsort()\npush(): return the length of the array after the push\npop()\nshift(): remove first element, and return the removed element\njoin(delimiter): concatenate the elements into a string\nsplice()\nAdd or remove elements from anywhere in an array\nReturn an arrary of removed elements\nParameters\nindex\nnumber of elements to remove\nelements to add\n\n\npush(item) is equivalent to splice(array.length, 0, item)\npop() is equivalent to splice(-1, 1) or splice(array.length - 1, 1)\n\n\n\nforEach()\n\nTake a function with three parameters\nelement\nindex (optional)\narray (optional)\n\n\nReturn undefined\nIterate through at most the number of elements before iteration\nIf new elements are added, they may be iterated as long as their index is wihtin the original iteration range.\nIf some elements are deleted, the iteration will not run into overflow issue.\n\n\nIterate the next element according to index\n\na = [0, 1, 2];\na.forEach(function(element, index, array) {\n  console.log(\"index \" + index + \" before: \" + element + \", \" + array);\n  if (index === 1) {\n    array.splice(index, 0, 10);\n  }\n  console.log(\"index \" + index + \" after:  \" + element + \", \" + array);\n});\n\n// index 0 before: 0, 0,1,2\n// index 0 after:  0, 0,1,2\n// index 1 before: 1, 0,1,2\n// index 1 after:  1, 0,10,1,2\n// index 2 before: 1, 0,10,1,2\n// index 2 after:  1, 0,10,1,2\n\n\nIn the example, an element is added to the array, but the iteration only goes through three elements.\nElement 1 is iterated through twice, because it is the second element before the change, and then pushed to the third position after the change, and the iteration goes from second to third position, regardless of the added element.\n\nElemented are passed by value (reference)\n```js\nvar arr = [{ num : 1 }, { num : 2 }, { num : 3 }];\narr.forEach(function(part, index) {\n// part and arr[index] point to the same object, so\n// changing the object that part points to also changes\n// the object that arr[index] points to\npart.num = 4;\n});\nconsole.log(arr);\n// [{ num : 4 }, { num : 4 }, { num : 4 }]\n\n\nvar arr = [{ num : 1 }, { num : 2 }, { num : 3 }];\narr.forEach(function(part, index) {\n  // change part to point to a new object will\n  // not change the objects stored in arr\n  part = 4;\n});\nconsole.log(arr);\n// [{ num : 1 }, { num : 2 }, { num : 3 }]\n```\nmap()\n\nReturn a new array from the original array\n\n"},"intro-to-javascript/07-objects.html":{"url":"intro-to-javascript/07-objects.html","title":"Objects","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Objects\n\nObjects are data structures that store data, and help track of that data by keys.\nObjects have properties and methods.\ntypeof operator: return name of the data type\nObject-literal notationvar umbrella = {\ncolor: 'red',\nisOpen: false,\nopen: function() {\n  umbrella.isOpen = true;\n}\n}\n\n\nData retrieval\nBracket notation: umbrella['color']\nDot notation: umbrella.color\n\n\nNaming conventions\nDon't wrap property names in quotes.\nSpecial propery names can be put inside quotes.

invoking a method, the JavaScript interpreter looks for them along the prototype chain in this order:\nThe object's own properties.\nThe object's constructor's prototype.\nAt the very end of the chain is the Object() object, or the top-level parent.\nIf the property still cannot be found, the property is undefined.\n\n\nBy adding methods to the prototype, memory is saved as more objects are
